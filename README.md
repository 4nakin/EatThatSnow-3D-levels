# Eat That Snow 3D Levels

## Description
This is a simple lab displaying 3D levels from Eat That Snow game.

It uses Three.js and therefore requires a WebGL compatible browser (latest Firefox and Chrome are ok). 

Here is the [demo](http://labs.gtomee.com/ets-3D-levels/).

For the moment, the demo only displays the level 4, but you can discover the other levels through the original game :)
